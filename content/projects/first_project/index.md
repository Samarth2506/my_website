title: Automated Trading Strategy with Reinforcement Learning
summary: In the quest for a robust trading strategy capable of navigating the dynamics of a complex environment, Reinforcement Learning algorithms offer significant advantages over traditional Machine Learning techniques. In this paper, we propose multiple deep learning models capable of predicting signals that capture sentiment and major events that affect the stock prices of companies.

In the quest for a robust trading strategy capable of navigating the dynamics of a complex environment, Reinforcement Learning algorithms offer significant advantages over traditional Machine Learning techniques. In this paper, we propose multiple deep learning models capable of predicting signals that capture sentiment and major events that affect the stock prices of companies. Signals from the models along with a point estimate from a Time Series models are used as to build a trading agent using a state of the art Actor Critic Reinforcement Learning model. The approach yields a return of 14% average profit on the training data.
