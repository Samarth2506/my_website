I am a graduate student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Robotics at Johns Hopkins University. Prior to graduate school, I worked with Fortune 500 companies to deploy Data Science solutions at scale. 

I also enjoy teaching and have developed case studies in Python/R to implement Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. This website showcases my projects and interests.
