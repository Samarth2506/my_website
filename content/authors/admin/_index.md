I am a graduate student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Johns Hopkins University. Prior to graduate school, I worked with Fortune 500 companies to deploy Data Science solutions at scale. 

Currently, I am building an open source Python application to learn and teach AI at the JHU Data Science Lab. I am also interning part-time with a Michigan based analytics firm working on Computer Vision problems. 

I am passionate about solving real world problems through Data Science tools I have picked up professionally and academically over the years. I also enjoy teaching and have developed case studies in Python/R to implement Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. This website showcases my projects and interests.
